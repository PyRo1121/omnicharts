# Competitive parity matrix

## Landscape

| Product | Focus | Platforms | Pricing model | OmniCharts takeaway |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| [Streams Charts](https://streamscharts.com/) | Market intelligence, tools, news | 15+ | PRO $80+, per-platform modules, API credits | **Primary UX reference** for homepage MVP |
| [StreamMetrix](https://streammetrix.com/) | Cross-platform DB, agencies | Twitch, YouTube, Kick (rolling) | Unknown / freemium | Closest direct competitor positioning |
| [SullyGnome](https://sullygnome.com/) | Deep Twitch history, games | Twitch | Free (donations) | Gold standard for **multi-year Twitch** — we cannot match day one without years of ingest |
| [TwitchTracker](https://twitchtracker.com/) | Channel/game stats | Twitch | Free + ads | Strong channel pages; reference for charts |
| [StreamElements](https://streamelements.com/) | Streamer tools, overlays | Twitch, etc. | Free tools | Complementary, not analytics-first |
| Twitch native / YouTube Studio | Own-channel only | 1 each | Free | No cross-channel rankings |

**Positioning:** OmniCharts = **Streams Charts–class homepage and rankings** for **Twitch + Kick + YouTube**, **free**, with transparent methodology and API — not 15 platforms or 35 tools on day one.
